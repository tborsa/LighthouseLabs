# SQL CONTINUED: A Data Story

Notes and code [here](https://github.com/tborsa/LighthouseLabs/tree/master/lectures/Week4/Day1/Breakout)

## FOREIGN KEYS ðŸ¤– ðŸ”‘

- Foreign key columns. Add `_id` to the singular name of the column you are referencing. Students to cohorts would be `cohort_id`. The type would be `INTEGER` but you also should create the foreign key with `REFERENCES cohorts(id) ON DELETE CASCADE`.

Using `ON DELETE CASCADE` for foreign key references. If we delete an artist then we may want to delete all of the albums that point to the record. The cascading delete functionality is a [constraint](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/ddl-constraints.html). It is not necessary to use CASCADE. If you don't you may notice some issues when trying to delete something that has a foreign reference to it.

## Group By & Aggregates ðŸ“Š

Aggregate functions allow you to perform calculations on groups of data in a query. 
An aggregate function returns a single scalar value.
Are often used with GROUP BY and HAVING clauses.

The following are the most commonly used SQL aggregate functions:

- AVG â€“ calculates the average of a set of values.
- COUNT â€“ counts rows in a specified table or view.
- MIN â€“ gets the minimum value in a set of values.
- MAX â€“ gets the maximum value in a set of values.
- SUM â€“ calculates the sum of values.

```sql
SELECT album_id, count(id) AS track_count
FROM tracks
GROUP BY album_id;
```

### GROUP BY ðŸ¤¹

Groups rows that have the same value into summary rows.
Squishes common rows into one.

Aggregate functions look at the individual rows before they are squished.


### HAVING ðŸ¤—

Functions the same as a WHERE clause, but is used after the rows are grouped.

WHERE filters the rows before they are grouped.

```sql
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column_name(s)
HAVING condition;
```

# GROUP BY and SELECT ðŸ¤¹   

If we are using GROUP BY...
Anything we specify in a SELECT must appear in the the GROUP BY
or must be an aggregate function.

```
id  |                  title                  | number | album_id

WHERE column_name IN (value1, value2, ...);
```
