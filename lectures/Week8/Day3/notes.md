### Final Projects

It time to start our final project. Before we do, let's go over a few
things shall we....

1. Team Members
2. Project Description
3. Tech stack (and short reason why)
4. Project Name
5. Preferences for mentor (if any)

#### Picking a project

There are many reason for picking a project.

* Are you trying to build something impressive for prospective employers?
* Are you trying to explore a technology?
* Are you trying to practice your existing set of skills?

#### Development Process

##### Defining a MVP (i.e. scopes and feature sets)

* What do you want your project to do?
* How do you know if it works?
* Will it be responsive?
  * Sketch a mobile/responsive version
  * Do you need a mobile & web scenario in your User Stories?
* If you're not going to demo a feature, do you need to build it? (If
you're launching it, yes you do.)

##### User Stories

* https://medium.com/@jonatisokon/a-framework-for-user-stories-bc3dc323eca9
* When is a feature complete?

##### Wireframes

* Based on user flow from user stories
* Do NOT use a wireframe program. Sketch quickly instead (sharpies, whiteboard, etc.) - Ignore details early on.
See: https://signalvnoise.com/posts/1061-why-we-skip-photoshop
* A wireframe for EVERY page of your app
Based on user flow from user stories

* Be specific about data points on the page

* Storyboard the user workflow

* Tools:

  - https://moqups.com
  - https://balsamiq.com
  - https://wireframe.cc

* Re-wireframe a mobile/responsive version
*Do you need a mobile & web scenario in your User Stories?


##### ROUTES

* If models are nouns, these are verbs
* RESTful
* Each _action_ that your models need to do

##### GIVE YOURSELF MILESTONES

* Set due dates
* Set development targets
* MEET THEM
* USE TRELLO

##### SMART Goals

* Specific
* Measurable
* Achievable
* Relevant
* Time-based

##### Git

* Don't code on master
* Code on a feature or bugfix branch, always
* Switch to master
* Merge
* Delete old branch...ONLY WHEN YOU ARE SURE MASTER WORKS
* Make new branches for each feature or bugfix that you're working on
* DO NOT MERGE TEN MINUTES BEFORE THE DEMO

##### Give Yourselves Milestones

* Demo Day: August 27th
* Set due dates
* Set development targets
* Check in often with your team
* MEET THEM
* Medium to long term planning
  * Trello - http://trello.com
  * Asana - http://asana.com
* Short Term (Dayboard - https://dayboard.co)

#### Technology Stack

##### Server Framework

* Sinatra
* Rails
* Node
* Node w/ Express
* Or choosing something else

##### JS MVC Framework

* None
* jQuery
* Angular
* Ember
* Backbone
* React
* Meteor
* Why do you want this?
 * Because it's "cool"
 * Because you want the skill for a job
 * Because you read a tutorial on it

##### UI FRAMEWORK

* Skeleton
* Bootstrap
* Foundation
* Pure
* Bourbon
* RESPONSIVE?
  * Re-wireframe a mobile/responsive version
  * Do you need a mobile & web scenario in your User Stories?

##### Picking a Database

* PostgreSQL
* SQLite
* MongoDB
* Redis

##### Scaffolding

* Download all resources you will need
* Figure out how to install them
* Are you going to use a generator?
  * Gulp vs. Grunt - Yeoman vs. Slush
  * Bower
* Back-end or front-end

##### Front-end Scaffolding

* Build static pages first
* Get the CSS to work
* Decide on ID's and classes

##### Back-end Scaffolding

* Start with models
* All database validations
* Figure out your callbacks
* Use as many helper methods (code atomically) as you can

##### DEPLOYMENT

* Demo on localhost:3000?
* Deploy to Heroku
* Buy a domain, put on AWS or DigitalOcean?
* If you're not going to demo a feature, do you need to build it? If you're launching it, yes you do.
