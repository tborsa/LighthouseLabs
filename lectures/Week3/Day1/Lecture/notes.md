## Bootcamp


You'll notice that while this week has more new concepts (every week will), our approach to teaching with you will adjust a bit. Overall as the weeks progress there is lesser emphasis on giving you all the resources, functions, tips that you need to complete an activity, and more expectation of you to poke around until you find an answer.

This means that during lecture if/when a new concept comes up that you don't fully understand, consider writing it down and researching it post-lecture. There are too many new things that you'll encounter directly or tangentially in morning lecture for everyone to ask "What's XYZ?". That is a question for Google before it should become one for us. We're happy to discuss XYZ with you once you've spent some time trying to understand it for yourself.

## Tweeter

We will work a little more on front end and styling with html and css with this project.

DEMO

---

## What we are focusing?

Looking at css and the box model and to get a history of css.

Writing maintainable CSS is tough, and comes with experience. Not everyone is good at it, even at 
CSS Box model is the focus for today, and it still has many confusion parts, many hacks. You'll encounter some this week. For this reason, you really need to (especially at first) "poke things until they work".

---

## what we are not focusing on today?

- we are not looking at css frameworks 
Bootstrap (CSS/UI grid frameworks in general) comes later. It makes more sense to focus on vanilla CSS.
- SCSS (also known as Sass) is a better way to write CSS, and there are other alternatives to it. You'll be learning SCSS in Week 4 to implement your Midterm (requirement).
- we are not focusing on html 
    - do want to look at semantic html 

---

## Semantic html 

The Idea that your html should express what the content it holds is. 
Tags whose names describe their purpose.

For example using <strong> tag instead of <b>

---

```HTML
<div>Rocks</div>
<div>
    Rocks are cool
    <div>
        üóø
    </div>
</div>
<div></div>
```
---

```HTML
<header>Rocks</header>
<article>
    Rocks are cool
    <figure>
        üóø
    <figure>
</article>
<footer></footer>
```

# TOOLS

- Chrome
    - Developer tools
DevTools is your biggest friend with front-end development

cross out vs grey out(div is see through)

#CSS

![waterfall](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tborsa/LighthouseLabs/master/lectures/Week3/Day1/Lecture/assets/waterfall.gif)

Cascading Style Sheets

- acts like a tiered waterfall
    styles cascade or flow downwards adding to the styles below them.

The cascading algorithm determines how to find the value(style) to apply for each property for each document element.

DEMO 

---

### 3 ways to apply styles 

Embeded
``` HTML
<style> </style> 
```

External StyleSheet*

```HTML
<link rel="stylesheet" href="waterfall.css">
```
```CSS
.inner{
    font-weight: 700;
    color: snow;
}
```

Inline 
``` HTML
<div class="box inner four" style="color: coral"></div>

```

* Embbeded and External styleseets are applied in the order that they appear on the HTML document. You should think about the order that you want things applied. 

---

# Syntax

```CSS
selector list{
    property: value,
}
```

---

# Reset / Normalize

![reset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tborsa/LighthouseLabs/master/lectures/Week3/Day1/Lecture/assets/reset.gif)

Reset  
A reset is removing any default browser styling, often called the user agent stylesheet. 
The Goal is to remove any browser inconsistancies. 

https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/


Normalize

>"Resets impose a homogenous visual style by flattening the default styles for almost all elements. In contrast, normalize.css retains many useful default browser styles. This means that you don‚Äôt have to redeclare styles for all the common typographic elements."

- Preserves user defaults
- Corrects common bugs

# Box Model

![Box Model](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tborsa/LighthouseLabs/master/lectures/Week3/Day1/Lecture/assets/boxmodel.png)

Margin -> { Border -> Padding -> Content }

DEMO boxes

```CSS
*, *:before, *:after {
    border: 4px solid red;
}
```

# Box Sizing

DEMO How big is this box 

http://guyroutledge.github.io/box-model/


---

## Box Sizing contd

Content-box
- Height/Width = Content Size.
- Padding & Border additionally add to the size of the box.
- Cannot set total box size.

Border-box? 
- Height/Width = Content Size + Padding + Border.
- Padding & Border acounted for in size.
- Width/Height sets total box size. 

It is better to use border-box

```CSS
*{
    Box-sizing: border-box (non-default)
}
```

---

# Block vs Inline

Block Level:
- Starts on a new line
- Takes as much width as it can by default
- Structural
- Default: <div>,<h1>-<h6>,<p>,<ul>,<nav>

Inline: 
- Does not start on a new line
- Doesn't effect the elemnts around it
- Can't set width or height ext..
- Content related
- Default: <span>,<a>,<input>,<button>,<img>

---

### nesting

__Don't__ put block elements inside inline
```HTML
    <a><div>Block</div></a>
```
* can cause inconsistent render, conflict between properties
** is a violation of html standards

__DO__ put inliine inside block 

```HTML
   <div> <a>Inline</a></div>
```

Block and Inline are display properties, and can be changed in CSS
```CSS
    p{
        display: block;
    }
```
*another display property is inline-block.

# Float ‚õµ

![Magazine](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tborsa/LighthouseLabs/master/lectures/Week3/Day1/Lecture/assets/magazine.jpg)

Magazine layout => web layout

```CSS
    div{
        float: left; //or left or right
    }
```

DEMO

clear floats
When we want our elements to start after an element that has been floated we have to *clear* the float.

```CSS
    div{
        clear: both; //or left or right
    }
```

Inline-Block  
- Behaves like inline but you can set a width and height.
- Like Block but does not add a line break after the element.

# Looking into the Future/Present üî≠

## Flexbox üí™üç±

Aims to correct some of the frustrating parts of the box model by rewriting how we layout the page, but it is not yet universally adopted (sorta).

Box Model is far more common as a layout engine, and is something you need to know.

Flex box is widely supported: http://caniuse.com/#feat=flexbox

Good to know the box-model and the evolution of CSS
before flexbox.

---

## CSS Grid üì∞

![CSS GRID](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tborsa/LighthouseLabs/master/lectures/Week3/Day1/Lecture/assets/grid.png)

It is even newer than Flexbox, but isn't well-adopted yet. It is something you can learn on your own (and it is recommended that you do so).
