this is not a tutorial on websockets 
main goal is to get stoked on what you can do with web sockets!

look at web sockets with react

websockets is a protocol there are many options for socket servers 

socker io 
and client ws

add client side socket 
what can i use as state and props?

how would i add ws as state?
in constructor? 
component will mount
this.ws = thing

twitch group play example 
red vs blue 
pokemon battle 

pass method down to let the child components use socket


show dev tool trying to connect and getting communication back 


look at socket io
and the differences
websocket built into the client raw
but have to use a client side client for socket io
makes it easy tocrrate types of messages
a level of abstraction

keep render as simple as possible
