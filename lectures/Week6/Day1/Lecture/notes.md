welcome back!

# comp sci week?

lecture and breakout connected 

react!
makes front end aproachable and structured
move away from the wild west  


# why does react exist?

jquery:

lets you reeach aroind and grab/effect th+ings in the dom 

gimmick for react
conponents!

react is framework! (some dispute this as Library)
library vs framework?
library helps solve a problem a set of functions 
framework library with strict opinions, enforces structure to my code
framework you are commited to the framework 

we wilk use react as a framework for client side applications
why client sidd app?
- ejs sucksss
- have to mix and match jquery patch stuff together

- react has structure 
- applications that can adapt to chnage 
- want modular design (react modular by default)

# Spa?
tweeter
one page and parts of the page reload (with ajax)

shift in where logic happens-
buisness logic shiftes to fron end
handles when we want data and how we dispkay data 
server that can return/recieve data insteaf of html 


backend -> api
application program interface 
backend that makes data and actions available

# component
visual block of ui 
lego pieces that make our reacy app
example with YouTube

general similar structure with different data/ some  pilymorphism 

visual stuff abd behaviors  


# Demo
scrimba 

look at mosy basic component 

classes?

render 
return 
jsx? javascript + xml

making elements with jquery vs jsx

return one object/ from return 
 draw out application on board/draw
 break it into components 
 
start from a visual place! 
nice designs to break down into conpinents 

rectangles around an existing site to show component breakdown 
rectangles = componrnts?

code one component (yeezy head)
use in parent component as a html tag 

hard coded component then later dynamic component 

videolist component
video tile as many jsx elements vs as component 

class vs classname 

want each video to be different 

# props!

components are functions that rerurn visual stuff

props = parameters

input anything in the form of attributes 

this.props is an object!

forgot a prop? no big deal

i
add non string props {}
run any js in jsx with {}

# review on what has been done

# tour of the boilerplate

run boilerplate

Dont worry about the config files
not important for making the app and components
dont have to touch index.jsx only have to use app.

copy paste scrimba example to boilerplate

jsx inject number {} 

can pass anythng as props!

pass a function as props on click,


later
# Declarative vs imparative
# Data down actions up
# Looping
# state


# Tools

- React dev tools
  - lets you see the react project tree, props
