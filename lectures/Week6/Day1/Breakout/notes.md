#state
 can use global scop but dont want to use that
 props->custom info recieved from a parent
  -If props changes the component will re render itself
 State ->memory that a component can hold itself
  - if state changees the component will re render

State is a components own memory
  - can think for itself

  - fucntion upward to effect parent state
    (increase number)

    -bind this???
    (after error )
    -bind or arrow function
    -clicking function that
    this.state.number++ does not update the dom

    inside function can delcare methods without const or declarations

    Add featured video that changes when you click on a particular video 
    -have to change state from below
    -change video source and title 

    addcounter to component and render many of them

# Unique key prop

# SetState

transform [data] -> [components]

map to components 

# condtional rendering 
with if
ternerary
(thng)&& (thing to output)

# stateless functional component
NOt talking about state can simplify your component
