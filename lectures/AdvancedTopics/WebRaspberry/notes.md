# Raspberry Pi

image of available boards

Affordable Single board computers. 
Full computers can run operating systems. 

Raspbery has a main boad line and a smaller zero board line. Difference in size and 1 vs 4 cores
Pi main line over the years has a faster cpu. 

Within the main board line there are a and b models the a board is more compact with less ports and slightly less ram

# OS

## Raspbian
Can choose desktop(GUI) vs lite(Commandline only)

It employs the Openbox stacking window manager and the Pi Improved Xwindows Environment Lightweight coupled with a number of pre-installed software which includes Minecraft Pi, Java, Mathematica, and Chromium.

## Ubuntu core

## Windows core

## RetroPie

## Media player OS

# Coding with PI

write code on your computer
Transfer file to pi
Best
Set up remote repository
- clone project to pi and run.
- pull from repository any new changes.
