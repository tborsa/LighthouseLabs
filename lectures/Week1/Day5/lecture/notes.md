### Preamble ðŸ“¢

Today we will look at:
- Modules
  - exports
  - require
- npm
- Unit Testing
 - Mocha
 - Chai

## What is a Module?ðŸ–¥

A module is a way of encapsulating some functionality(code) so that it can be used in other JavaScript files. 

This allows us to:
- have files that have clear and seperate purposes.
- reduce the amount of code in a single file.
- Make code usable across multiple different files and contexts. 
- Only exposes the what of the module not the how. 

//Demo

## Module Creation

### exports 

Within a Node.js JavaScript file the 'module' keyword is a special object that represents the current module. module.exports or exports is a variable (part of the module object) that specifies what the current module will export.

module -> represents the current module

module.exports -> tells the module what will be exported.

``` module.exports = {};
    module.exports.thing = something;
```


### require

From another file a module can be imported with require. require retrives the module.exports from the specified file and makes it available to the current file. 

``` var module = require('module-name');
```

If File A has:  

module.exports = "hello";

And in File B we use:

var greeting = require("./fileA.js");

Then:

greeting <=> "hello"

Similarly...

If File A has:

module.exports.one = 1;
module.exports.two = 2;

And in File B we use:

var numbers = require("./fileA.js");

Then:

numbers <=> { one: 1, two: 2}


//make code into module

## npm ðŸ“¬

npm or node package manager is a tool that helps us download and interface with node packages. 

## What is a Package?

![Package](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tborsa/LighthouseLabs/master/lectures/Week1/Day5/lecture/assets/package.gif)


A package is one or more modules grouped together to serve a common purpose. 

Where a module is a single file, a package is a collection of files packaged together. 

People create packages and publish them for others to use. We can use other peoples packages/code instead of having to write similar code ourselves. 

[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) has a index of all published packages. 

//look at an example of a package

## package.json

Information about the package/project. It has general information as well as information about configuration and dependencies. 

## dependencies?

In a node project dependencies are other packages that the current project depends on or requires in order to run properly.


## Creating and using packages

To use a package we have to initialize our current project with.

``` $ npm init
```

this will create a package.json file in the current folder, letting the package manger know that the current folder is a node project. 

Then we have to install the package that we want to use. 
There are a few options for installing a package. 

To install a package for the current project
``` $ npm install packagename --save

To install a package for development purposes for the current project
``` $ npm install packagename --save-dev

This will:
- update the package.json file to list the newly installed package as a dependency. 
- download the package to the node_modules folder, creating it if it does not already exist. 

The other option for installing a package is:

``` $ npm install packagename -g
```

This will install a package globally making it accessable across any folder.
This is generally used if the package provides command-line tools and is not specific to your project. 

// init demo project
// use chalk

# Unit testing
![unittest](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tborsa/LighthouseLabs/master/lectures/Week1/Day5/lecture/assets/unittest.gif)

Dividing a program into pieces, and individually checking if each piece functions as it should.

Practically this can be as simple as testing whether a function, given a certain input, returns the correct output. 

---

### MochaðŸ“”

Mocha is a JavaScript test framework for Node.js programs. It helps to organize and manage our tests.

[Docs](https://mochajs.org/)

### Chai

Chai is an assertion library. It provides easy syntax for describing how we want things to look/be.  

example: 

```
var assert = require('chai').assert;
var foo = 'bar';
assert.typeOf(foo, 'string'); // without optional message
assert.typeOf(foo, 'string', 'foo is a string'); // with optional message
assert.equal(foo, 'bar', 'foo equal `bar`');
assert.lengthOf(foo, 3, 'foo`s value has a length of 3');
```
If the assertion fails chai throws an error. 

[Docs](https://www.chaijs.com/guide/styles/)

//use mocha and chai to test project

### Mock Test ðŸ“¬

![test](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tborsa/LighthouseLabs/master/lectures/Week1/Day5/lecture/assets/test.gif)


- It is open book, meaning you can use previous code and the internet
- You can get help from mentors and peers, but should endeavour to see how much they can do on their own
- You have until Sunday to get 100% on the test, so should make sure they don't get behind on today's work
- It is an assessment of the JS fundamentals you have been working on all week, not a reason to stress
- The main purpose is to get you used to the format of testing at Lighthouse, in prep for the W2D5 test
